### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kate and I am a PhD student in Geophysics at Stanford. In my research, I seek to refine and apply radar remote sensing techniques (mainly InSAR) to study the deformation of volcanoes and ice sheets on Earth and other planets.
I graduated from the University of Virginia with degrees in computer science and environmental sciences. I'm especially interested the exploration of ocean worlds such as Europa.
