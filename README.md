### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You can find some of my most creative personal projects here. Explore my code!
- Currently, I'm working on a project that generates a dynamic visual representation of songs using Java Swing and an API for song lyrics. I've been very interested in creating art through code lately.
- My previous project included algorithms that create customized playlists in Spotify.
