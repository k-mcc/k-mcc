### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You can find some of my most creative personal projects here. Explore my code!
- Currently, I'm perfecting a website I built that allows for surgical patients to generate a timetable that tracks their post-op medications.
- My previous project generated a dynamic visual representation of a musical artist using Java Swing and an API for song lyrics. Before that, I developed algorithms that create customized playlists in Spotify.
